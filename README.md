Simpletron Machine Language

Simpletron Machine Language is an interpreter that simulates a machine language program. The user writes the machine language code in a JSON file and then uses Node.js to run the program, which executes the instructions in the file.
The inspiration for this program came from Deitel's "Java How to Program, 5th Ed".
This is my first official Javascript version of this program.

* Rewrote the program in Javascript with the browser for I/O.
* Stored and displayed values in hexadecimal.
* Modified the program to run in a Node JS environment, using the command line for I/O.
