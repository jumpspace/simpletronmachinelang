Simpletron Machine Language is an interpreter that simulates a machine language program. The user writes the machine language code in the form of a JSON file, 
then uses Node.js to run the program, which executes the instructions in the file.

This is my first official version of this program.

The inspiration for this program came from Deitel's "Java How to Program, 5th Ed".
